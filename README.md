## Full_Stack developer, from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

[My Portfolio](https://nadiia-tsytsylina.github.io/portfolio/)

I am a high-performing software engineer capable of working in a highly agile software development process. Experienced in covering complex tasks with tight deadlines.

I successfully completed a three-month internship at ZenBitTech as a Full-Stack Developer. During that time, I explored a wide range of technologies, strengthened my problem-solving skills, and gained hands-on experience that fundamentally shaped my approach to coding.

Currently, I work at CGS-Team as a Full-Stack Developer, bringing real-world commercial experience to my projects. I take pride in quickly learning new tools and frameworks, writing clean and maintainable code, and always striving to meet deadlines without compromising quality.

I love challenges that push me to grow, enjoy collaborating with teammates, and believe that every project is an opportunity to learn something new and make a meaningful impact.
